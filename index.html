              Maximum Appraisal for Investment.</h4> -->
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">A Suggested Basis of
              Maximum Appraisal for Investment.</span> The investor in common
              stocks, equally with the speculator, is dependent on future rather
              than past earnings. His fundamental basis of appraisal must be an
              intelligent and conservative estimate of the future earning power.
              But his <em>measure</em> of future earnings can be conservative
              only if it is limited by actual performance over a period of time.
              We have suggested, however, that the profits of the most recent
              year, taken singly, might be accepted as the gage of future
              earnings, <em>if</em> (1) general business conditions in that year
              were not exceptionally good, (2) the company has shown an upward
              trend of earnings for some years past and (3) the investor’s study
              of the industry gives him confidence in its continued growth. In a
              very exceptional case, the investor may be justified in counting
              on higher earnings in the future than at any time in the past.
              This might follow from developments involving a patent or the
              discovery of new ore in a mine or some similar specific and
              significant occurrence. But in most instances he will derive the
              investment value of a common stock from the average earnings of a
              period between five and ten years. This does not mean that all
              common stocks with the same average earnings should have the same
              value. The common-stock investor (i.e., the <em>conservative</em>
              buyer) will properly accord a more liberal valuation to those
              issues which have current earnings above the average or which may
              reasonably be considered to possess better than average prospects
              or an inherently stable earning power. But it is the essence of
              our viewpoint that some moderate upper limit must <em>in every
              case</em> be placed on the multiplier in order to stay within the
              bounds of conservative valuation. We would suggest that <em>about
              20 times average earnings</em> is as high a price as can be paid
              in an investment purchase of a common stock.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although this rule is of necessity arbitrary in its nature, it is
              not entirely so. Investment presupposes demonstrable value, and
              the typical common stock’s value can be demonstrated only by means
              of an established, <em>i.e.</em>, an average, earning power. But
              it is difficult to see how average earnings of <em>less than</em>
              5% upon the market price could ever be considered as vindicating
              that price. Clearly such a price-earnings ratio could not provide
              that <em>margin of safety</em> which we have associated with the
              investor’s position. It might be accepted by a purchaser in the
              expectation that future earnings will be larger than in the past.
              But in the original and most useful sense of the term such a basis
              of valuation is <em>speculative.</em> It falls outside the purview
              of common-stock investment.
            </p>
            <p>
              <i>Higher Prices May Prevail for Speculative Commitments.</i> The
              intent of this distinction must be clearly understood. We do not
              imply that it is a mistake to pay more than 20 times average
              earnings for any common stock. We do suggest that such a price
              would be speculative. The purchase may easily turn out to be
              highly profitable, but in that case it will have proved a wise or
              fortunate speculation. It is proper to remark, moreover, that very
              few people are consistently wise or fortunate in their speculative
              operations. Hence we may submit, as a corollary of no small
              practical importance, <em>that people who habitually purchase
              common stocks at more than about 20 times their average earnings
              are likely to lose considerable money in the long run.</em> This
              is the more probable because, in the absence of such a mechanical
              check, they are prone to succumb recurrently to the lure of bull
              markets, which always find some specious argument to justify
              paying extravagant prices for common stocks.
            </p>
            <p>
              <i>Other Requisites for Common Stocks of Investment Grade and a
              Corollary Therefrom.</i> It should be pointed out that if 20 times
              average earnings is taken as the <em>upper limit</em> of price for
              an investment purchase, then ordinarily the price paid should be
              substantially less than this maximum. This suggests that about 12
              or 12½ times average earnings may be suitable for the typical
              case of a company with neutral prospects. We must emphasize also
              that a reasonable ratio of market price to average earnings is not
              the only requisite for a common-stock investment. It is a
              necessary but not a sufficient condition. The company must be
              satisfactory also in its financial set-up and management, and not
              unsatisfactory in its prospects.
            </p>
            <p>
              From this principle there follows another important corollary,
              <em>viz.: An attractive common-stock investment is an attractive
              speculation.</em> This is true because, if a common stock can meet
              the demand of a conservative investor that he get full value for
              his money plus not unsatisfactory future prospects, then such an
              issue must also have a fair chance of appreciating in market
              value.

              There is no reason at all for thinking that the average
              intelligent investor, even with much devoted effort, can derive
              better results over the years from the purchase of growth stocks
              than the investment companies specializing in this area. Surely
              these organizations have more brains and better research
              facilities at their disposal than you do. Consequently we should
              advise against the usual type of growth-stock commitment for the
              enterprising investor. This is one in which the excellent
              prospects are fully recognized in the market and already reflected
              in a current price-earnings ratio of, say, higher than 20. (For
              the defensive investor we suggested an upper limit of purchase
              price at 25 times average earnings of the past seven years. The
              two criteria would be about equivalent in most cases.)
